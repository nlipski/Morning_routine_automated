# Morning routine script

There are multiple things I want to do every morning before work, but usually I get way too distracted or just forget what to do.
So to solve I need things to already be on the screen in the morning.
Goals of this script will be updated constantly.

### Expected Functionality

1. Create a journal entry every morning with templated goal outlines
2. Integrate notes with personal Evernote account
3. Keep statistics on journal entry length, time it takes to write, and consistensy
4. Push the goals as reminders to Google Calendar?
